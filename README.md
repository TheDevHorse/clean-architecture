# **Clean Architecture**

## **Overview**

Your project is a well-structured application designed following the principles of **Clean Architecture**, emphasizing clarity, maintainability, and scalability. The architecture organizes the application into distinct layers, each with specific responsibilities, ensuring that the core business logic remains independent of external frameworks or implementations.

## **Key Components**

### **Domain Layer**
- Represents the core of the application, containing the fundamental business logic and entities. 
- This is the heart of the system, where all critical business rules reside, ensuring they are unaffected by changes in other layers.

### **Use Case Layer**
- Implements application-specific operations by defining and orchestrating the business logic. 
- This layer acts as a bridge between the domain and the external world, ensuring the integrity of processes such as creating, updating, or retrieving data.

### **Ports**
- Defines interfaces that establish boundaries between the use case layer and external systems.
  - **Input Ports**: Facilitate communication with the applicationâ€™s core.
  - **Output Ports**: Abstract interactions with external components such as databases or APIs, promoting flexibility and independence.

### **Infrastructure Layer**
- Handles implementation details, including data persistence and communication with external systems.
- Ensures that the rest of the application remains decoupled from the technical details of external resources.

## **Benefits of This Design**

1. **Separation of Concerns**:  
   Each layer has a clear role, making the application easier to understand, modify, and extend.

2. **Testability**:  
   By isolating business logic from external dependencies, the application becomes easier to test.

3. **Flexibility**:  
   The use of interfaces and boundaries allows for seamless replacement or updating of external components without affecting the core logic.

4. **Scalability**:  
   The structure supports growth, whether adding new features or integrating with additional systems.
